```

### **Detailed (2 lines):**
```
Engineered high-performance C++17 event stream processor with lock-free ring buffers 
and probabilistic data structures (Count-Min Sketch, HyperLogLog), achieving 1.1M+ 
events/sec throughput for Discord platform handling 10K+ daily events with batched 
PostgreSQL writes reducing database load by 500x.

Implemented O(log n) skip list-based leaderboard engine with time-decay scoring, 
achieving sub-microsecond update latency (0.9µs median) and 7.1µs top-10 queries—
2,500x faster than PostgreSQL ORDER BY. Integrated via pybind11 with Python/Django 
backend maintaining 100% test coverage and zero memory leaks.

## 🎤 **Interview Script (Practice This)**

**Q: "Tell me about your most impressive technical project."**

> "I built high-performance C++ extensions for a Discord engagement platform that 
> was experiencing severe database bottlenecks. The system handled 10,000+ events 
> per day, but synchronous PostgreSQL writes were causing 150ms latency spikes and 
> connection pool exhaustion.
>
> I profiled the application and identified two critical hot paths: event logging 
> and leaderboard queries. For event logging, I implemented a lock-free MPMC ring 
> buffer based on Dmitry Vyukov's algorithm, achieving 1.1 million events per second 
> throughput with batched database writes—reducing database load by 500x.
>
> For the leaderboard, I implemented a skip list data structure with exponential 
> time-decay scoring, achieving 0.9 microsecond update latency and 7.1 microsecond 
> top-10 queries. This was 2,500x faster than the previous PostgreSQL ORDER BY 
> approach.
>
> I integrated everything with the existing Python/Django stack using pybind11, 
> carefully managing the GIL to avoid deadlocks in the callback mechanism. I also 
> implemented probabilistic data structures—Count-Min Sketch for frequency 
> estimation and HyperLogLog for cardinality estimation—to provide real-time 
> analytics with constant-time queries.
>
> The result: 100% test coverage, zero memory leaks, and production deployment 
> with measurable performance improvements."
