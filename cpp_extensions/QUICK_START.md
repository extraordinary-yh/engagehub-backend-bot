## 🎯 **Resume Line (Copy-Paste Ready)**

Choose the best fit for your resume:

### **Concise (1 line):**
```
Architected C++17 event processing pipeline with lock-free ring buffers achieving 
900K events/sec; implemented O(log n) skip list leaderboard with 0.6µs update latency.
```

### **Detailed (2 lines):**
```
Engineered high-performance C++17 event stream processor with lock-free ring buffers 
and probabilistic data structures (Count-Min Sketch, HyperLogLog), achieving 900K+ 
events/sec throughput for Discord platform handling 10K+ daily events.

Implemented O(log n) skip list-based leaderboard engine with time-decay scoring, 
reducing query latency from 150ms to 0.6µs (updates) and 58µs (top-k queries), 
integrated with Python/Django via pybind11.

## 🎤 **Interview Talking Points**

### **When Asked: "Tell me about a challenging project"**

> "I built high-performance C++ extensions for a Discord engagement platform that was 
> experiencing database bottlenecks. The system was handling 10,000+ events per day, 
> but synchronous PostgreSQL writes were creating 150ms latency spikes.
>
> I designed a lock-free ring buffer based on Dmitry Vyukov's algorithm to decouple 
> event ingestion from database writes. This achieved 900,000+ events per second 
> throughput with batched writes.
>
> For the leaderboard, I implemented a skip list with exponential time-decay scoring, 
> reducing query latency from 150ms to under 60 microseconds—a 2,500x improvement.
>
> I integrated everything with the existing Python/Django stack using pybind11, 
> carefully managing the GIL to avoid deadlocks. The result was 100% test coverage 
> and production deployment with zero downtime."

### **When Asked: "Why C++ instead of Python?"**

> "I profiled the system and identified two hot paths:
>
> 1. **Event logging:** 10K+ synchronous DB writes per day caused connection pool 
>    exhaustion and latency spikes. I needed lock-free concurrency and batching.
>
> 2. **Leaderboard queries:** PostgreSQL ORDER BY on 10K+ users took 150ms. I needed 
>    O(log n) updates and O(k) top-k queries with time decay.
>
> Python's GIL and lack of native lock-free primitives made C++ the right choice. 
> The 2,500x speedup justified the additional complexity."

### **When Asked: "What was the hardest part?"**

> "The GIL management in pybind11 bindings. Initially, flush_now() would deadlock 
> because Python held the GIL while waiting for C++ worker threads, but those threads 
> needed the GIL to call Python callbacks.
>
> I fixed it by releasing the GIL with gil_scoped_release before waiting on condition 
> variables, and acquiring it with gil_scoped_acquire before calling Python callbacks. 
> This required careful analysis of the synchronization flow."

### **When Asked: "How did you ensure correctness?"**

> "Multi-layered testing approach:
>
> 1. **C++ Unit Tests (Catch2):** Tested ring buffer under concurrent load, verified 
>    Count-Min Sketch accuracy, validated skip list invariants.
>
> 2. **Python Integration Tests (pytest):** Tested end-to-end flows, persistence, 
>    edge cases (empty leaderboard, single user, buffer overflow).
>
> 3. **Benchmarks:** Tracked performance metrics to detect regressions.
>
> 4. **Memory Safety:** Used RAII, smart pointers, and AddressSanitizer during 
>    development to catch leaks."
