## 🎯 **Resume Line (Choose Best Fit)**

### **Option 1: Systems & Performance Focus**
```
Architected high-performance C++17 event processing pipeline achieving 900K+ 
events/sec throughput using lock-free ring buffers and probabilistic data 
structures (Count-Min Sketch, HyperLogLog), reducing Discord event logging 
latency from 150ms to <100ns per event. Integrated seamlessly with Python/
Django backend via pybind11 for cross-language interoperability.
```

### **Option 2: Algorithms & Data Structures Focus**
```
Implemented O(log n) leaderboard engine in C++17 using skip lists with time-
decay scoring, achieving 0.6µs median update latency and 58µs top-k queries—
150x faster than PostgreSQL. Designed lock-free MPMC ring buffer and integrated 
probabilistic data structures (Count-Min Sketch, HyperLogLog) for real-time 
analytics at scale.
```

### **Option 3: Production & Integration Focus**
```
Built production-grade C++ extensions for Discord engagement platform processing 
10K+ daily events, implementing lock-free concurrency, skip lists, and probabilistic 
data structures. Achieved 900K events/sec throughput and sub-microsecond leaderboard 
queries. Integrated via pybind11 with Python/Django stack with comprehensive test 
coverage.
```

### **Option 4: Comprehensive (2 lines)**
```
Engineered high-performance C++17 event stream processor with lock-free ring buffers 
and probabilistic data structures (Count-Min Sketch, HyperLogLog), achieving 900K+ 
events/sec throughput for Discord platform handling 10K+ daily events.

Implemented O(log n) skip list-based leaderboard engine with time-decay scoring, 
reducing query latency from 150ms to 0.6µs (updates) and 58µs (top-k queries),

## 🎤 **Interview Talking Points**

### **Systems Design:**
- "Profiled Django ORM queries and identified N+1 problem in leaderboard computation"
- "Designed lock-free ring buffer to avoid mutex contention in hot path"
- "Used cache-line alignment to prevent false sharing"

### **Algorithms:**
- "Chose skip lists over red-black trees for simpler implementation with similar O(log n)"
- "Implemented Count-Min Sketch for space-efficient frequency estimation"
- "HyperLogLog provides cardinality estimation with <2% error using only 12KB"

### **Concurrency:**
- "Lock-free ring buffer uses memory_order_acquire/release for synchronization"
- "Thread pool avoids creating/destroying threads for each task"
- "GIL management critical for Python callback integration"

### **Trade-offs:**
- "Skip list probabilistic nature acceptable for leaderboard use case"
- "Chose pybind11 over ctypes for type safety and better error messages"
- "Batched writes trade latency for throughput"
