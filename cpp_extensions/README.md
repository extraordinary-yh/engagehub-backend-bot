# EngageHub C++ Extensions

High-performance native modules that accelerate EngageHub's Discord ingestion pipeline and leaderboard engine. The codebase is organised into two pybind11-backed extensions:

- `cpp_event_processor`: lock-free event ingestion, probabilistic statistics, and batched persistence hooks.
- `cpp_leaderboard`: O(log n) leaderboard with time-decayed scoring and crash-safe persistence.

## Architecture Overview

```

Run `python python_integration/benchmark_comparison.py` to regenerate numbers on your hardware.

## Building the Extensions

### Using CMake directly

```bash
cd cpp_extensions
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build
```

### Editable install via pip

```bash
cd cpp_extensions
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

This compiles both extensions with `-O3 -march=native` and exposes `cpp_event_processor` and `cpp_leaderboard` to Python.

## Usage Examples

```python
import cpp_event_processor
import cpp_leaderboard

processor = cpp_event_processor.EventStreamProcessor(
    buffer_size=10000,
    num_threads=4,
    batch_size=1000,
    flush_interval_ms=1000,
)

leaderboard = cpp_leaderboard.Leaderboard(decay_factor=0.95)

# Hook into Django ORM bulk writes
processor.set_flush_callback(lambda events: print(f"Persisting {len(events)} events"))

processor.push_event("message", "123", "general", 1696284800)
leaderboard.update_user("123", points=25.0, timestamp=1696284800)

print(processor.get_top_channels(5))
print(leaderboard.get_top_users(3))
```

See `python_integration/example_usage.py` for a more complete end-to-end snippet.

## Algorithms & Data Structures

- **Lock-Free Ring Buffer**: Vyukov-style bounded MPMC queue protects ingestion; producers never block and drops are tracked.
- **Thread Pool**: Dedicated worker pool ensures flush callbacks never execute on the ingestion thread.
- **Count-Min Sketch**: Summaries trending channels with bounded error using MurmurHash3; updates are O(depth).
- **HyperLogLog**: 14-bit precision (~1% error) for unique-user estimates; sliding one-minute windows keep last-hour views.
- **Skip List Leaderboard**: Deterministic ordering by decayed score with O(log n) insert/update and fast top-k scans.
- **Lazy Time Decay**: Scores are normalised on query, avoiding background jobs while maintaining monotonic decay.
- **JSON Persistence**: Human-readable crash recovery storing decay factor, limits, and user scores.

## Testing & Tooling

- C++ unit tests (Catch2) cover concurrency primitives, probabilistic structures, and leaderboard logic.
- Python integration tests (pytest) validate end-to-end flows, persistence, and decay semantics.
- Benchmarks (Python + Catch2) offer quick feedback on throughput and latency targets.

Run all tests:

```bash
cmake --build build --target event_processor_tests leaderboard_tests
ctest --test-dir build
pytest python_integration
```

## Future Improvements

- SIMD-accelerated Murmur hashing and HyperLogLog register updates.
- Batch-serialised flush payloads (flatbuffers/Cap’n Proto) to reduce Python marshalling cost.
- GPU offloading for large-scale decay recalculations or bespoke CUDA kernels for sketches.
- Integrate Prometheus metrics for live throughput, drop rate, and flush-duration dashboards.
- Adaptive flushing tuned via PID controller reacting to database back pressure.

## Resume Highlight
